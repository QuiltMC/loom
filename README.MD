# Quilt Loom
- add the Quilt Releases repository to projects automatically
- read the quilt.mod.json metadata of mods correctly, enabling JiJ, transitive access wideners, interface injection, etc to work properly
- Use Quiltflower by default via loom-quiltflower by Juuxel
- Automatically apply the Quilt Mappings on Loom plugin
- Output jars with hashed mappings, remap dependencies from both hashed and intermediary
